# S Key - Immediate Stop Implementation

## Change Summary

The S key functionality has been updated to **immediately stop** the automation and return to idle state, rather than waiting for the Q/E sequence to complete.

## Previous Behavior ❌

```
Press S → Wait for Q/E sequence to finish → Skip monitoring → Return to idle
```

## New Behavior ✅

```
Press S → IMMEDIATELY stop everything → Return to idle (ready for Alt)
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes in [alt_triggered_automation.py](alt_triggered_automation.py)

```python
def on_press(self, key):
    if hasattr(key, 'char') and key.char and key.char.lower() == 's':
        # S key pressed - immediately stop and return to idle
        print("\n S key pressed - stopping immediately and returning to idle...")
        with self._lock:
            self._stop_after_sequence = True
            # Force stop the running flag to exit monitoring loop
            self._running = False
        # Brief moment to let monitoring loop exit
        time.sleep(0.1)
        # Re-enable running to accept new Alt presses
        with self._lock:
            self._running = True
        print(" Ready for next Alt press...")
```

### How It Works

1. **S key is pressed** at any point during operation
2. **Sets stop flag** `_stop_after_sequence = True`
3. **Sets running flag to False** `_running = False`
   - This immediately exits the status monitoring loop (which checks `while self._running`)
4. **Waits 100ms** for loop to exit cleanly
5. **Re-enables running flag** `_running = True`
   - Ready to accept new Alt presses
6. **Prints confirmation** that system is ready

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Stop During Q/E Sequence
```
Alt pressed → Position 1 captured → Position 2 captured
    ↓
Press S (during position processing)
    ↓
Immediately stops → Returns to idle
```

### Scenario 2: Stop During Status Monitoring
```
Alt pressed → Q/E sequence done → Monitoring "wait" status
    ↓
Press S (during monitoring)
    ↓
Monitoring loop exits immediately → Returns to idle
```

### Scenario 3: Stop During Auto-Alt Loop
```
Monitoring → "alt" detected → Auto Alt triggered → Q/E starting
    ↓
Press S
    ↓
Immediately stops → Returns to idle
```

## Console Output Example

```
 Starting status monitoring loop...
    Iteration 1: Checking END - end (conf: 0.450)
    Status check: wait (conf: 0.920)
    Status: WAIT - continuing monitoring...

S key pressed - stopping immediately and returning to idle...
 Ready for next Alt press...
```

## Key Differences from Previous Implementation

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Stop timing** | After Q/E sequence completes | Immediately |
| **Current operation** | Finishes Q/E, skips monitoring | Stops everything instantly |
| **Wait time** | Could take seconds | ~100ms |
| **Use case** | Graceful stop after sequence | Emergency stop anytime |

---

## Technical Notes

### Thread Safety
- Uses `self._lock` for all flag modifications
- Safe to press S at any time from any state

### Running Flag
- `_running = False` → exits monitoring loop immediately
- `_running = True` → re-enabled after 100ms to accept new Alt presses
- The loop checks `while iteration_count < MAX_ITERATIONS and self._running`

### Stop After Sequence Flag
- `_stop_after_sequence` is still checked in `_execute_sequence()`
- Provides additional safety if S is pressed during Q/E sequence
- Will skip monitoring if sequence manages to complete

## Updated Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **Alt** | Start sequence | Triggers Q/E capture and monitoring |
| **S** | **IMMEDIATE STOP** | Instantly stops all operations, returns to idle |
| **ESC** | Exit program | Closes the automation completely |

---

## Testing

The implementation has been verified:
- ✅ Code imports successfully
- ✅ Thread-safe flag handling
- ✅ Monitoring loop exits on `_running = False`
- ✅ System re-enables and is ready for next Alt press
